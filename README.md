# Truemail

The main idea of this gem is to validate emails by regex pattern, presence of domain mx-records, and real existence of email account on a current email server.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'truemail'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install truemail

## Email Validation Methods

Email validation is a tricky thing to do properly. There are a number of different ways to validate an email address. All checking mechanisms conform to best practices, and provide confident validation.

**Syntax Checking**: This checks the email addresses via regex pattern.

**Mail Server Existence Check**: This checks the availability of the email address domain using DNS MX records.

**Mail Existence Check**: This checks if the email address really exists and can receive email via SMTP connections and email-sending emulation techniques.

## Usage

TODO: Complete usage instructions here.

```ruby
Truemail.configure do |config|
  # Required parameter. It should be an existing email on behalf of which verification will be performed
  config.verifier_email = 'email@example.com'

  # Optional parameter. It should be an existing domain on behalf of which verification will be performed. By default verifier domain based on verifier email
  # config.verifier_domain = 'somedomain.com'

  # Optional parameter. You can override default regex pattern
  # config.email_pattern = /regex_pattern/
end
```
